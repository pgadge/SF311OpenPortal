<p class="style1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style1">The San Francisco Recreation and Park Department has a rich tradition of 
providing clean, safe and fun park experiences to the public.&nbsp; People are 
using our parks more than ever--- 30 percent more, according to a recent study. 
We&#39;ve increased the number of registered families who use our programs to more 
than 25,000, and volunteers dedicated more than 129,000 hours to our Department 
last year. Tens of millions of people visit our parks every year, with an 
estimated 13 million annual visitors to Golden Gate Park alone.</p>
